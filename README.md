  ## Description
  This project was created to assist users in making a high-quality professional README to reuse on their applications. It contains sections you would commonly see on a README such as what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it and to make contributions. This app can be generated through the command line and saves users time. For the sake of this project, some of the sections are intentionally left blank to demonstrate all of the sections that can be generated.
